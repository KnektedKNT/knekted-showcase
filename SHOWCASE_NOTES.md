# Showcase notes (internal)

- Do NOT upload the PDF/whitepaper.
- Keep the wording as a “concept summary” / “draft” because the document will be changed.
- Avoid language that could be interpreted as promoting illegal activity.
- If adding images/graphics to the showcase:
  - use mockups, generic diagrams, and non-sensitive data only.
  - no keys, internal URLs, DB schemas, endpoints, or screenshots containing PII.
