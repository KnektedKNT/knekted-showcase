# KNEKTED (Showcase)

This repository is **public showcase only**.

- The original **whitepaper PDF is NOT published here** (it’s being revised/rewritten).
- The codebase, backend, infrastructure, and operational details remain **private**.

## What is KNEKTED?
KNEKTED is a concept for a platform focused on **trading valuable information and multimedia content** (e.g., photographs, reports, documents), designed to reduce intermediaries and improve **creator monetization**.

## Problems it targets (summary)
- **Information centralization**: large agencies/corporations capture most of the upside.
- **Price discovery**: creators lack an open market to discover the real value of their content.
- **Creator capitalization**: providers are often the least rewarded.
- **Time-to-market**: content can lose value without a fast global distribution channel.

## High-level solution
- A marketplace governed by **smart contracts**.
- A utility/exchange token: **KNT** (ERC‑20 / Ethereum).
- Publishing tools: tagging, cataloging, watermarking, pricing, etc.
- Sales models: **direct purchase** and/or **auctions**.
- Seller reputation/ratings to build trust.
